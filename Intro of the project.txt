what i understand is that i need to make some different color buttons which represents different colors and once i press thm the background color should change respectively as that of the color of button


You'll create different buttons for various colors, such as red, green, blue, etc.
When a button is clicked, the background color of the page should change to match the color of the button.
Additionally, you also need to allow the user to add custom colors to the color panel. This means the user should be able to input a color, and that new color should also appear as a button in the panel, which they can click to change the background to that custom color.
